##General
Develop a website that consists of at least four pages: a home page and three content
pages.

You decide what subject you’re going to use for your website. It can be about you, a
relative, a friend, a pet, a course, a hobby, a product, an issue…you decide.

Be sure that you know enough about the subject of your website so it will be easy for
you to create the content for your pages. If possible, you should also have three or
more related image files that you can use in your web pages.
